GOAP Programming Guidelines

The following link is a set of guidelines for writing code in C++. 

No member of the team is required to follow these guidelines strictly. As long as the code is still readable and does not confuse the reader any change is fine. 
However there are a couple exceptions (listed below that I expect everyone will follow).

Exceptions:

No function/method/variable name should have abbreviations.
Example: 
NO – “getDist();”
YES – “getDistance();”

All functions/methods names should contain a verb.
Example: “calculateXplusY();” “getNumberOfItems()”

All functions/methods/variables that are/return a Boolean should have the prefix “is”.
Example: “isThere;” “isGetItem();”

Function arguments should have the same name as their type or something logical and short.
Example:
NO – “computeDistance(int a, int b, Point c);”
YES = “computeDistance(int one, int two, Point point);”

Class variables should be kept private/protected and access to them should be given using getter and setter methods.
